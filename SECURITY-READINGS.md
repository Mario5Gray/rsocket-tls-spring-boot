### What is a PEM?

PEM or Privacy Enhanced Mail is a Base64 encoded DER certificate.  PEM certificates are frequently used for web servers as they can easily be translated into readable data using a simple text editor.  Generally when a PEM encoded file is opened in a text editor, it contains very distinct headers and footers.  Below are some examples of different files in PEM format.
